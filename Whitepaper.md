AI-Driven SIEM Monitoring and Response - Whitepaper

An AI-powered security monitoring and response system.

1. Introduction

Cyber threats are evolving at an unprecedented pace, and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems often struggle to keep up. Traditional SIEM solutions generate excessive alerts, leading to alert fatigue and inefficient incident response. This whitepaper introduces an AI-driven SIEM monitoring and response system designed to enhance cybersecurity by:

🚀 Reducing false positives and unnecessary alerts.

🔍 Dynamically adjusting security policies based on real-time analytics.

🤖 Implementing federated learning to improve threat detection without compromising privacy.

⚙️ Enabling user-configurable automation to balance efficiency and control.

How AI detects and mitigates threats in real-time.

2. Problem Statement

Challenges in Current SIEM Solutions

⚠️ High Alert Volume: Security teams are overwhelmed with alerts, many of which are false positives.

⏳ Manual Response Delays: Investigating and responding to security incidents requires significant manual effort.

📏 Lack of Adaptive Learning: Most SIEM solutions rely on static rule-based detection, making them ineffective against evolving threats.



3. Proposed Solution

The AI-driven SIEM monitoring and response system leverages machine learning and automation to provide an adaptive and scalable security solution.
